# Auto-Regression-vs-Linear-Regression
Sales Data Forecasting (A R vs L R models)

Sales data is being analysed with an Auto regressive model and Linear model to compare the performance of predicting the future. 
We will explore how auto regressive models do not always guarantee superior performance. 
So, having a core understanding of how these models work can give us more insights in choosing the appropriate models for our datasets.
